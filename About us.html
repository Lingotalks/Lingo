                <h1>About Our Website</h1>
                <p>Learners nowadays prefer to acquire new skills, such as language proficiency. The "LINGO TALK WEBSITE" is both an online language learning website and a digital language quiz. This website will be developed for Grade 9 Special Curriculum students who are attempting to learn Spanish and Korean. Through this website, they will improve their grammar, and vocabulary. Learning a language is difficult and expensive, which is why we are developing this website to help them learn a language for free. This website will allow the student to keep up with conversations in multiple languages. They can use this website to learn every word until they master it, which will include words ranging from simple to challenging. This website will be updated as new languages are added for students to learn. This website will be released after extensive testing and development. This website will provide learners with everything they need in learning a new language.</p>
